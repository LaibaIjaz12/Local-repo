#Lists in python are mostly similar than arrays in JavaScript
list = ["apple", " Mango", "banana"]
print(type(list), list[0]) #type of a list , and assing value at the index 0

# Lists are mutable___ means we can chnage or add a new element in the list 
# changing value in the list using index
mutated = list[0] = "Strawberry" 
print(mutated, list) #it will not genrate the new list after changing it upddates the orignal lists


#------Lists methods-----
# ____.append()_____it adds new element at the ends of the list

list.append('Mango')
print(list)

#_____.sort____ it sort list by default in acceending order, there are sorting so many algorithms to sort 
list1 = [0, 1,100, 234, 44,66,1000, 0.45, 1.94]
newlist = list1.sort() # not generate a new list it will produce "none"
print(newlist, list1)
list1.sort(reverse= True)# it will sort the list into descending order
print(list1)

#sorting is also possible when the list's elements are strings
list.sort(reverse=True)
print(list)
